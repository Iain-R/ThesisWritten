\section{Operations Research Background}
The field of operations research is a mathematical discipline specailising in the application of advanced analytical methods to make better decisions for specified problems. Often considered as a subsection of applied mathmatics operations research employs techniques from mathmatical modelling and optimization theory to calculate optimal or near optimal solutions to complex decision making problems. \\ Naturally this branch of mathematics lends itself to the problem of optimal block dimensions in a strip mine, with the use of optimal decisions through either precise calculation or policy the best possible solution can be found using the field of operations research. The scope of this field is diverse, with many potential solutions to a problem, however the generation of the matematical model will aid in selecting a method that will obtain results quickest. \newline
Mathematical modelling is a vital section of operations research, however the problem can be written and formulated in many different ways, as such the specific formulation styles of a technique will also be mentioned in that section, modelling in general can follow some simple rules yet no overall method or technique exists for the creation of a mathematical model, it is instead reliant on understanding of the system. 

\subsection{Linear Programming}
Linear programming is a technique used to obtain the optimal outcome of a model such as the minimal time or highest profit. This method can only be aplied to a mathematical model with a linear objective function subject to linear equality and linear inequalitiy constrants.\\ Often the model is described as groups of variables and contstraints with an overall objective function.
